# QR Generator Web App Using Flask

QR Code generator web application made using Flask and deployed using Heroku. You can visit the [website here.](https://qr-flask.herokuapp.com/)

#### Frameworks:
- Install the dependencies; the required packages are present in the **[requirements.txt](/requirements.txt)** file.
- It is best to run a virtual python environment for this project. I used  ```pipenv``` as my virtual environment but the default python env can be used as well.
